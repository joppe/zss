# Button object

The button object is a gathering of common button properties. It centers the text, removes underlines and adds a pointer cursor.

## Source files

- [objects/_button.scss](../../src/objects/_button.scss)

## Usage

- Add `o-button` to your element to want to look like a button.
    - Optionally, add the modifier `o-button--full-width` to make the element span the entire width of it's parent.

## Examples

```html
<a class="o-button  o-button--full-width" href="#">
    A link that looks like a full-width button.
</a>
```
