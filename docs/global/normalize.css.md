# Normalize.css

To quote their website:

> Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.

The file is included in ZSS because Sass does not support importing regular CSS files. Current included version is `5.0.0`.
